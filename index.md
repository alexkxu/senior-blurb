## Senior Blurb
### ISB Class of 2019

I was first enrolled at ISB in August of 2008 as a grade 2 student, the past eleven years here have given me a lot to say, probably exceeding what can be written in a single page on the yearbook. I'll be using this Github page to try my best to encapsulate my thoughts for my senior blurb.
